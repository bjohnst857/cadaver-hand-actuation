# Cadaver Hand Actuation

Motor control software and a LabVIEW operator interface for the biomechanical
evaluation of cadaveric human hands. The system drives tendon cables with
brushless motors while measuring cable tension with load cells, enabling
controlled, repeatable actuation of the fingers for biomechanics research.

Developed in the Towles biomechanics lab.

## Overview

Each finger tendon is routed over a load cell and wound onto a motor-driven
spool. A [moteus](https://mjbots.com/) brushless servo controller commands each
motor in position, velocity, or torque mode, and [Phidget](https://www.phidgets.com/)
bridge inputs read load cells to measure the resulting tension in Newtons.

The project is organized in three layers:

- **Low-level control libraries** (`labview/`) — thin Python wrappers around the
  `moteus` and `Phidget22` APIs that expose simple, synchronous calls (move,
  hold, torque, read tension, set limits) for single- and multi-motor rigs.
- **Operator interface** (`labview/*.vi`) — LabVIEW front panels that call those
  Python functions, giving an operator real-time control and telemetry without
  touching code during an experiment.
- **Characterization scripts** (`motor_testing/`) — standalone scripts that drive
  the motor through known position/velocity/torque profiles, log motor telemetry
  and load cell output, and save plots and CSVs for analysis.

## Hardware

- mjbots **moteus** brushless servo controller(s), one per motor (CAN-FD over USB)
- Brushless motor with a cable spool per actuated tendon
- **Phidget** VoltageRatioInput bridge (e.g. 1046) with S-type and/or inline load cells


## Usage

**Calibrate a load cell and stream live tension:**

```bash
python load_cell_calibration.py
```

Follow the prompts to tare, enter five known weights, and supply the cable wrap
angles. The script then prints live mass, force, and tension; press `0` + Enter
to re-zero and Ctrl+C to stop.

**Run a characterization test** (motor must be connected and calibrated):

```bash
python motor_testing/Tests/trq_test.py   # also: pos_test.py, vel_test.py
```

Each test drives a known command profile, logs telemetry and load cell output,
and saves a timestamped plot and CSV in the working directory.

**Operate the rig from LabVIEW:** open the VIs in `labview/`. They import the
Python control libraries (configure the Python environment path via
`py_venv_init.vi` / `add_to_path.vi`) and expose move, torque, and telemetry
controls for single- and multi-motor setups.

## Notes

- Motor IDs default to 1 (and increment for multi-motor rigs); change them in the
  relevant `start` / `start_multi` call to match your CAN bus.
- Load cell calibration constants in `phidget_funcs.py` are specific to the cells
  and wiring used here and should be re-derived for a different setup using
  `load_cell_calibration.py`.
